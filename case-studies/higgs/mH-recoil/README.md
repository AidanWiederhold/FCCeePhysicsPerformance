## The Higgs boson mass from the recoil mass

### Abstract

A precision on mH as small as 5 MeV can be achieved from a fit to the distribution of the mass recoiling to 
a leptonically-decaying Z boson (Z → e+e− or μ+μ−) in the e+e− → ZH process at √s = 240 GeV. 
The requirements on the detector design (*electron energy and muon momentum resolution*, in particular) to achieve this statistical precision will be checked with this channel in the FCC-ee context. The feasibility of a calibration of the method – to reduce systematic effects due to, e.g., momentum scale determination and stability – will be ascertained with the e+e− → ZZ → l+l−X process. 
The need for calibration data at the Z pole will also be estimated (frequency, number of events).

for the determination of the recoil mass.
