Case-Studies
=============

Each case study should eventually use commonly produced events in the common data model EDM4Hep. To run over those common samples, an efficient analysis framework has been developed [FCCAnalyses](https://github.com/HEP-FCC/FCCAnalyses/tree/master/). For each analyses, it is requested to store and maintain the four ```FCCAnalyses``` python configuration files in a directory called ```FCCAnalyses-config``` with a possible directory structure inside in case several configurations are needed for various channels like for example ```case-studies/higgs/mH-recoil/FCCAnalyses-config/ee/``` and ```case-studies/higgs/mH-recoil/FCCAnalyses-config/mumu/```.
