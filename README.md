### Towards the definition of detector requirements

**Goal:** Circular colliders have the advantage of delivering collisions to multiple interaction points, which allow different detector designs to be studied and optimized â€“ up to four for FCC-ee. On the one hand, the detectors must satisfy the constraints imposed by the invasive interaction region layout. On the other hand, the performance of heavy-flavour tagging, of particle identification, of tracking and particle-flow reconstruction, and of lepton, jet, missing energy and angular resolution, need to match the physics programme and the exquisite statistical precision offered by FCC-ee. Benchmark physics processes will be used to determine, via appropriate simulations, the requirements on the detector performance or design that must be satisfied to ensure that the systematic uncertainties of the measurements are commensurate with their statistical precision. The usage of the data themselves, in order to reach the challenging goals on the stability and on the alignment of the detector, in particular for the programme at and around the Z peak, will also be studied. In addition, the potential for discovering very weakly coupled new particles, in decays of Z or Higgs bosons, could motivate dedicated detector designs that would increase the efficiency for reconstructing the unusual signatures of such processes. These studies are crucial input to the further optimization of the two concepts described in the Conceptual Design Report, CLD and IDEA, and to the development of new concepts which might actually prove to be better adapted to (part of) the FCC-ee physics programme.

- To determine the detector requirements set by the physics programme, a [first list of case studies](https://indico.cern.ch/event/951830/contributions/4000220/attachments/2095812/3522643/SNOWMASS21-EF0-NF0-RF0-TF0-IF0-CompF0-017.pdf)  has been put together. Most of them have been expanded in "Letters of Interest" that were submitted at the end of August 2020 to the Snowmass 2021 process. These contributions have been collected in [this repository](https://indico.cern.ch/event/951830/), mostly under the contributions to the "Energy Frontier".

- Other documents submitted to Snowmass 2021:
    - LOIs sent by the [CEPC](https://indico.ihep.ac.cn/event/12410/) collaboration
    - LOIs sent by the [CALICE](https://agenda.linearcollider.org/event/8647/) collaboration
